# puff-up-voodoo-test
Test task for Voodoo (new games)


Reproduce the core gameplay of one of the following games using Unity3D:
- Hole.io
- Puff Up
- Castle Raid

Don’t implement side features (for example: skin shop, leaderboard, fake ads…).

We still require a main menu and lose/win screens.

We will also positively value any polishes to the core gameplay, coherent haptic and scalable structure.

Give us your best to showcase your technical skills and your ability to make an enjoyable game!

The game should be fully functional on Android.
